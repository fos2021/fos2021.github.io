        <h3 id="description">Description</h3>

<p>Software foundations (or <em>theory of programming languages</em>) is the mathematical study of the <em>meaning</em> of programs. Students will learn ways to describe program behaviors, and mathematical tools to formalize and check interesting properties of programs. This course concentrates on operational techniques and type systems.</p>

<h3 id="announcements">Announcements</h3>

<p>Announcements about the course will be made through Moodle: https://moodle.epfl.ch/course/view.php?id=8061 .</p>

<!--

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>

<p>Each enrolled student will receive a grade based on their results for the
projects and the final exam. The relative importance of each part is: 40% for
projects and 60% for the final.</p>

<h3 id="cheating">Cheating</h3>

<p>Sharing ideas between groups is very recommended. Plagiarising code as part of a project will not be tolerated — whatever the source. In particular, you are not allowed to publish your projects in public repositories at GitHub/Bitbucket/… or to use solutions published by others.</p>

<p>In case of cheating, you will receive the grade “NA” (not acquired, zero) for the concerned project or exam, or for the whole course. You may furthermore be denounced and punished in accordance with the <a href="http://www.admin.ch/ch/f/rs/4/414.138.2.fr.pdf">ordonnance sur la discipline</a>. If you are in any fashion worried about this, speak with an assistant.</p>
